### About Me

I'm Nguyen Anh Minh MAI, currently working at [Valeo](https://www.valeo.com/en/) Driving Assistance Research (DAR), France. My primary focus is on perception of autonomous vehicles, wherein I work extensively with Valeo's raw sensor data, including cameras and lidar.

In early 2023, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Paul Sabatier University](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/english-version). During this time, I was a member of the [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) ([MINDS](https://www.irit.fr/en/departement/dep-signals-and-images/minds-team/) team), a joint [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) research unit, and [Cerema Center Research](https://www.cerema.fr/en) ([ITS](https://www.cerema.fr/en/innovation-recherche/recherche/equipes/its-intelligent-transport-systems-towards-greater-safety-and) team). My work here revolved around computer vision and deep learning, with a specific focus on scene understanding for autonomous vehicles. Throughout my Ph.D., I received valuable guidance and supervision from Dr. Louahdi Khoudour, Dr. Pierre Duthon, Prof. Alain Crouzil, Prof. Sergio A. Velastin, and Dr. Pascal Housam Salmane. Additionally, we collaborated with [Easymile](https://easymile.com/), enhancing our research outcomes. Additionally, during this time, I was a Research Engineer at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/) on addressing the 3D object detection problem for autonomous vehicles.

Back in 2019, I earned my M.Sc. (Diplôme d'Ingénieur) at [INSA CVL](https://www.insa-centrevaldeloire.fr/en). As part of my studies, I underwent internships at the [MIA](http://mia.univ-larochelle.fr/) lab in 2018, under the supervision of Prof. Christophe Saint-Jean. The following year, I had the privilege of interning at [CEA Paris-Saclay](https://kalisteo.cea.fr/index.php/ai/), where I was mentored by Dr. Brice Burger and Dr. Mohamed Chaouch, focusing on the research topic of 2D object detection.

Besides, by volunteering, I have served as Reviewer for  [ICPRS\`2023](http://www.icprs.org/), [BMVC\`2022](https://bmvc2022.org/people/reviewers/), [AJAI\`2022](/docs/Certificate_for_Reviewer.pdf), [Neurocomputing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/neurocomputing), [Springer Nature](https://www.springernature.com/gp); Teaching Assistant for [RLVS\`2021](https://rl-vs.github.io/rlvs2021/index.html#teaching-assistants); Editorial Board Member of [IJRAT](https://zealpress.com/jms/index.php/ijrat/about/editorialTeam).

My research interests include Image Processing, Computer Vision (cameras, Lidar), 3D Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Production Machine Learning, and Edge Devices and Systems.
