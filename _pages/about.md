I’m Minh, currently working at [Valeo](https://www.valeo.com/en/) Driving Assistance Research (DAR), France. My primary focus is on perception of autonomous vehicles, wherein I work extensively with Valeo’s raw sensor data, including cameras and Lidar.

In early 2023, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Paul Sabatier University](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/english-version). During this time, I was a member of the [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) ([MINDS](https://www.irit.fr/en/departement/dep-signals-and-images/minds-team/) team), a joint [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) research unit, and [Cerema Center Research](https://www.cerema.fr/en) ([ITS](https://www.cerema.fr/en/innovation-recherche/recherche/equipes/its-intelligent-transport-systems-towards-greater-safety-and) team). My work here revolved around computer vision and deep learning, with a specific focus on scene understanding for autonomous vehicles. Throughout my Ph.D., I received valuable guidance and supervision from Dr. Louahdi Khoudour, Dr. Pierre Duthon, Prof. Alain Crouzil, Prof. Sergio A. Velastin, and Dr. Pascal Housam Salmane. Additionally, we collaborated with [Easymile](https://easymile.com/), enhancing our research outcomes. Additionally, during this time, I was a Research Engineer at [VinAI](https://www.vinai.io/) on addressing the 3D object detection problem for autonomous vehicles, working closely with Nguyen Mau Dzung and Prof. Khoa Luu.

Back in 2019, I earned my M.Sc. (Diplôme d’Ingénieur) at [INSA CVL](https://www.insa-centrevaldeloire.fr/en). As part of my studies, I underwent internships at [MIA](http://mia.univ-larochelle.fr/) in 2018, under the supervision of Prof. Christophe Saint-Jean. The following year, I had the privilege of interning at [LVA, CEA-List](https://kalisteo.cea.fr/index.php/ai/), Paris-Saclay, where I was mentored by Dr. Brice Burger and Dr. Mohamed Chaouch, focusing on the research topic of 2D object detection.

Besides, by volunteering, I have served as Reviewer: BMVC (2022); Transportation Research Part C (2023); Signal Processing (2024);
Neurocomputing (2024) as well as Program Committee: ICPRS (2023, 2024); ITFT (2024); CIARP (2024).

My research interests include Image Processing, Computer Vision (cameras, Lidar), 3D Vision, NLP, Speech Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Efficient Deep Learning, Production Machine Learning, and Edge Devices and Systems.
