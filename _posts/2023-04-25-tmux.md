### Introduction

Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) is a powerful tool that allows you to split a single terminal window into multiple panes, run multiple sessions within a single terminal, and detach and reattach to sessions later across different terminals or even a different computer. This can be extremely useful if you need to work remotely or switch between different devices or simply protect your process because **the process will not be terminated when the terminal is closed or the connection is lost**.

### Key features
![](../../../assets/img/tmux.png)

Here's a brief overview of some of the key features of tmux:
- **Sessions**: a Tmux session is a collection of one or more windows, each containing one or more panes. You can create, rename, and switch between sessions using various Tmux commands.
- **Windows**: a tmux window is a full-screen pane that can be split into multiple panes. You can create, rename, and switch between windows within a session.
- **Panes**: a tmux pane is a sub-division of a window that allows you to view and interact with multiple terminals at once. You can split and resize panes vertically and horizontally, and switch between them using various tmux commands.
- **Detaching and reattaching**: one of the most powerful features of tmux is its ability to detach and reattach to sessions. This means that you can start a long-running process (such as a server or a script) in a tmux session, detach from the session, and then reattach to it later from a different terminal or even a different computer.
- **Customization**: tmux is highly customizable, with a wide range of configuration options and key bindings that can be modified to suit your needs.

### Basic commands

Here are some basic commands to get started with tmux.
#### Install and launch first tmux session
```bash
# install tmux:
$ sudo apt-get install tmux
# launch tmux:
$ tmux
```

In tmux we have **`Prefix = Ctrl + b (default)`**

#### Session

In tmux we can:
- Create/ Kill a session
    - Create:
        ```bash
        $ tmux new -s <session-name>
        ```
    - Kill
        ```bash
        $ tmux kill-session -t <session-name>
        ```
- Rename a session: 
    - Attach to the session, then rename it by `Prefix` + `$` + `<new-session-name>`, or
    ```bash
    $ tmux rename-session -t <old-session-name> <new-session-name>
    ```
- Attach to a session: 
    ```bash
    $ tmux attach -t <name-session>
    ```
- List all session:window: 
    ```bash
    $ tmux ls
    # 0: 2 windows (created Tue Apr 25 08:52:02 2023) [80x23] (attached)
    # 1: 1 windows (created Tue Apr 25 08:57:50 2023) [80x23] (attached)
    ```


#### Window

Inside a session we can:
- Create/ Kill a window: 
    - Create: `Prefix` + `c`
    - Kill: `Prefix` + `&`, or:
        ```bash
        $ tmux kill-window -t <window-number>
        ```
- Switch windows: `Prefix` + `<window-number>`
    ```bash
    # <window-number>: <window-name>
    [2] 0:bash* 1:bash  2:bash-
    ```
- Rename a window: switch to the window `Prefix` + `<window-number>`, then rename it by 
    - `Prefix` + `,` + `<new-window-name>`, or
        ```bash
        $ tmux rename-window <new-window-name>
        ```
- Exit a window: `exit`
- Detach: `Prefix` + `d`

#### Pane

Inside a window we can:
- Create a new pane:
    - horizontally: `Prefix` + `%`
    - vertically: `Prefix` + `"`
- Kill a pane: `Prefix` + `x`
- Switch panes: `Prefix` + `o`
- Move a pane: `Prefix` + `Ctrl + o`
