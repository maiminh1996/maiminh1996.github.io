### Introduction

As a developer, text editor is an important tool for me. In this blog post, we'll explore the world of `Vim` and discover how it can revolutionize your programming workflow.

So, let's start with reason it has gained a loyal following among developers:

### Why Vim?

Vim offers several advantages as follows:
- **Speed & Efficiency**: maximize keyboard shortcuts and eliminate mouse usage.
- **Customization**: tailor the editor to your specific needs and preferences such as keyboard mappings.
- **Extensibility**: provide a vibrant plugin ecosystem, support various programming languages, code linting, autocompletion, and more.

### Getting started with Vim


#### Installation

To begin your Vim journey, let's set up the editor and install some handy plugins.

Install Vim:
```bash
apt install vim
```

Install plugin manager, [VundleVim/Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```
Customize your Vim configuration by adding or updating plugins in `~/.vim/vimrc`. 

Download plugins (added in `~/.vim/vimrc`) by launching vim, running `:PluginInstall` and then `:source ~/.vim/vimrc`. Alternatively, you can do both things from the command line using:
```bash
vim +PluginInstall +qall
```

<u>As an example, you can check out</u> [MY-VIMRC](https://maiminh1996.github.io/assets/scripts/vimrc.txt):
```bash
apt purge vim && apt install vim
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
wget --no-check-certificate --content-disposition https://maiminh1996.github.io/assets/scripts/vimrc.txt -O ~/.vim/vimrc
vim +PluginInstall +qall
```


#### Three modes of Vim

`Vim` operates in three modes, each serving a specific purpose:
- Inserting and editing text: **INSERT**. Press `i` to enter this mode.
- Selecting and manipulating text:
    - **VISUAL** mode. Press `v` to select text character by character.
    - **V-LINE** (VISUAL LINE) mode. Press `V` to select text line by line.
    - **V-BLOCK** (VISUAL BLOCK) mode. Press `CTRL-v` to select text in a block format.
- Navigating and executing commands: **NORMAL** (COMMAND) mode. Press `ESC` to enter this mode.

<!-- #### Navigation in a file

In Vim, you can navigate through a file using the arrow keys &larr; &uarr; &darr; &rarr;  or the "H, K, J and L" buttons. To go to a specific line number (for example, line 15), type `:15`. -->

#### Tree explorer


The common file system explorer plugin, `:NERDTree`, facilitates navigation within your projects. Here are some key commands to remember:
- Open the selected file in a new tab: Press `t`.
- Open the selected file in a horizontal split window: Press `i`.
- Toggle NERD Tree's quick help: Press `?`.

- Move the cursor to the parent directory: Press `p`.

- Change the tree root to the selected directory: Press `C`.
- Move the tree root up a directory: Press `u`.


- Navigate between split windows by pressing `CTRL-w` and then use any navigation keys &larr; &uarr; &darr; &rarr; like accordingly to go to left, above, below and right respectively.
- Switch between different tabs: Press `gt` (next tab), `gT` (previous tab), or `<numbered-tab> gt` followed by the tab number.

- Refresh the folder (e.g.: after create/ delete files): Press `R`.



#### Tabs

For my convenience working with tabs in Vim, the tab shortcuts are mapped as follows in `~/.vim/vimrc`: 
```vim
" ~/.vim/vimrc
" In NORMAL mode, Switch tab with Ctrl + Right Arrow
nnoremap <C-Right> :tabnext<CR>
" Switch tab with Ctrl + Left Arrow
nnoremap <C-Left> :tabprev<CR>
" Create new tab with Ctrl + Tab
nnoremap <C-T> :tabnew<CR>
" In INSERT mode, Switch tab with Ctrl + Right Arrow
inoremap <C-Right> <Esc>:tabnext<CR>i
" Switch tab with Ctrl + Left Arrowe
inoremap <C-Left> <Esc>:tabprev<CR>i
" Create new tab with Ctrl + Tab
inoremap <C-T> <Esc>:tabnew<CR>i
```
And then in both mode NORMAL and INSERT I can:
- Open a new tab: Press `CTRL-t`.
- Switch to the next tab: Press `CTRL` &rarr;.
- Switch to the previous tab: Press `CTRL` &larr;.
- Close a tab: Press `CTRL-q`.
 

#### Files

Efficient editing is one of Vim's strengths. Here are some essential commands to enhance your editing workflow:

Insert text:
- At the current cursor position: Press `i`.
- After the current cursor position: Press `a`.

Select text:
- Selects multiple lines (excluding the entire line): Press `v` to enter VISUAL mode.
- Selects multiple lines (including the entire line): Press `V` to enter VISUAL LINE mode.
- Selects text in a block format: Press `CTRL-v` to enter BLOCK VISUAL mode, then use arrow keys for selection.

Copy, paste and cut:
- Copy:
    - A line: Press `Y` or **`yy`**.
    - Selected text (in VISUAL mode (`v`, `V` or `CTRL-v`)): Press `y`.
- Cut:
    - A line: Press `dd`.
    - Selected text (in VISUAL mode (`v`, `V` or `CTRL-v`)): Press `d`.
- Paste the text:
    - At the current cursor position: Press `P`.
    - After the current cursor position: Press `p`.


<!-- To copy or delete multiple lines of text, move the cursor to the beginning of where you'd like to copy or delete. Then, press `:` to bring up the command line at the bottom of the Vim window. To copy, type `y` followed by the number of lines you want to copy. For example, to copy four lines of text, type `y4`. To delete, type `d` followed by the number of lines you want to delete. For example, to delete four lines of text, type `d4`. -->


#### Undo/ Redo

Mistakes happen, but with Vim, you can easily undo and redo changes:
- Undo changes: Type `:u` or press **`u`**.
- Redo changes: Press `CTRL-r`.

#### Search/ Replace

Vim provides powerful search and replace functionality to modify your text efficiently:
- Replace text in all lines: Type `:%s/<text2search>/<text2replace>/g`. 
- Replace text in a specific line: Type `:s/<text2search>/<text2replace>/g`. 
- Search for a specific word without replacing: Type `/<text2search>` or Press **`CTRL-f`** (mapped in `~/.vim/vimrc`).
    - Search forward: Press `SHIFT-*`.
    - Search backward: Press `SHIFT-#`.

#### Save changes

Ensure your work is saved and manage file closures with these commands:
- Save changes: Type `:w` or type `:w [save-file-name]` to save new file.
- Save changes and quit: Type `:wq` or press **`ZZ`**.
- Force quit without saving changes: Type `:q!`.

#### Comment/ Uncomment

Comment a block of text in Vim:
- Move the cursor to the first line you want to comment.
- Press `CTRL-v` to enter VISUAL BLOCK mode and use arrow keys to select the lines.
- Press `I` to switch to INSERT mode and enter the comment character (e.g., `#` for a hash symbol).
- Press `ESC` (give it a second) to apply the comment character to all selected lines.

By using plugin `tpope/vim-commentary`:
- comment: `gcc`
- uncomment: `gc`




#### Tips

- Show diff before saving the file: Type `:w !diff % -`.
- Open Vim with the cursor on a particular line: Press `vim <linenum> <path/to/file>`.
- Split file: Type `:split <file>` or `:vsplit <file>`.
- By prefixing the command with `:!<cmd>` or `:term`, Vim opens up a terminal window and runs the specified command.
- Buffers:
    - Show list buffer files: Type `:buffers`, `:ls` or install the plugin `bling/vim-bufferline`.
    - Switch to a buffer: Type `b<num-buffer>`.
    - Delete a buffer: Type `:bdelete <filename>`.

<!-- ### Editing files remotely

Vim also supports editing files remotely, which can be useful if you need to work on a file located on a remote server. This can be done via FTP or SSH, for example. To edit a remote file over FTP, use the following syntax:
```bash
$ vim ftp://<username>@<hostname>/<path_to_file>
```
For example, to edit a file named test.txt located in the home directory of a user named jane on a server with IP address 192.168.1.100, you could use the following command:
```bash
$ vim ftp://jane@192.168.1.100/home/jane/test.txt
```
You will be prompted for a password if necessary. -->



### Customizing Vim

You can customize your Vim by modifying `~/.vim/vimrc` to define mappings, set options, and specify plugin settings to tailor Vim to your liking.

Some installed plugins in [MY-VIMRC](https://maiminh1996.github.io/assets/scripts/vimrc.txt):
- Markdown preview: [iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim). Type: `:MarkdownPreview` to start the preview or `:MarkdownPreviewStop` to stop the preview.
