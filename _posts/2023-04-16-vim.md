### Introduction

`Vim` is a powerful text editor that can help improve your productivity and streamline your workflow by **maximizing keyboard shortcuts** and **eliminating mouse usage**. In this blog post, we will cover some basic useful tips that can help you get started using Vim.

### The three modes of vim

Vim has three modes:
- **INSERT**: used for inserting and editing text.
- **VISUAL**: used for selecting and manipulating text.
- **NORMAL** (COMMAND): the default mode and used for navigating and executing commands.

Switching between modes by pressing the appropriate key:
- Switch to **INSERT** mode by pressing `i`.
- Switch to **VISUAL** mode by pressing `v`.
- Switch to **VISUAL LINE** mode by press `V` (select row instead of select word like VISUAL).
- Switch to **NORMAL** mode by press `ESC`.

### Navigation

#### Navigation in a directory

In Vim, you can Navigate through a directory using the arrow keys &larr; &uarr; &darr; &rarr; or the "H, K, J and L" buttons.
- Pressing `../` to return to the parent directory.
- Typing `:Rex` to return to explorer/ `:b#`: goes back to the "previously edited buffers"/ `:e#`: goes back to the "previously edited file" (by @aman-jain)/ 
`Ctrl-O`: jump back to the previous (older) location, not necessarily a buffer.
- Executing command by `:! <cmd>`.

```

#### Navigation in a file

In Vim, you can navigate through a file using the arrow keys &larr; &uarr; &darr; &rarr;  or the "H, K, J and L" buttons. To go to a specific line number (for example, line 15), type `:15`. -->

### Edit

Insert text:
- at the current cursor position by pressing `i`. 
- after the current cursor position by pressing `a`.

Select text:
- Selects text in a block format by pressing `CTRL-v` to enter BLOCK VISUAL mode. Then using &larr; &uarr; &darr; &rarr;.
- Selects multiple lines without including the entire line by pressing `v` to enter VISUAL mode.
- Selects multiple lines including the entire line by pressing `v` to enter VISUAL LINE mode.

Copy, paste and delete:
- Copy a line of text to the buffer by pressing `Y` or `yy`.
- Paste the contents of the buffer after the current cursor position by pressing `P`.
- Delete a line of text and place it in the buffer by pressing `dd`.

<!-- To copy or delete multiple lines of text, move the cursor to the beginning of where you'd like to copy or delete. Then, press `:` to bring up the command line at the bottom of the Vim window. To copy, type `y` followed by the number of lines you want to copy. For example, to copy four lines of text, type `y4`. To delete, type `d` followed by the number of lines you want to delete. For example, to delete four lines of text, type `d4`. -->

### Search and replace

- Replace text in all lines, type `:%s/<text2search>/<text2replace>/g`. 
- Replace text in a specific line, type `:s/<text2search>/<text2replace>/g`. 
- Search for a specific word without replacing, type `/<text2search>`.
    - Search in forward press `SHIFT-*`.
    - Search in backward press `SHIFT-#`.

### Undo and redo

- Undo changes by typing `:u` or pressing **`u`**.
- Redo changes by pressing `CTRL-r`.

### Save changes

- Save changes by typing `:w`.
- Save changes and quit by typying `:wq` or pressing **`ZZ`**.
- Force quit without saving changes by typing `:q!`.

### Customizing vim settings

Customize your Vim settings by editing your `~/.vimrc` file. Here is an example `~/.vimrc` file:
```vim
" enable syntax highlighting\n
syntax enable
" show line numbers\n
set number
" set tabs to have 4 spaces
set ts=4
" indent when moving to the next line while writing code
set autoindent
" expand tabs into spaces
set expandtab
" when using the >> or << commands, shift lines by 4 spaces
set shiftwidth=4
" show a visual line under the cursor's current line
set cursorline
" show the matching part of the pair for [] {} and ()
set showmatch
" enable all Python syntax highlighting features
let python_highlight_all=1
" to fix backspace not work, strange character since last update
set backspace=indent,eol,start
let &t_TI = ""
let &t_TE = ""
```
Then sourcing it,
```bash
source ~/.vimrc
```
<!-- or, during normal mode, type `:set number` to show number. -->

<!-- ### Editing files remotely

Vim also supports editing files remotely, which can be useful if you need to work on a file located on a remote server. This can be done via FTP or SSH, for example. To edit a remote file over FTP, use the following syntax:
```bash
$ vim ftp://<username>@<hostname>/<path_to_file>
```
For example, to edit a file named test.txt located in the home directory of a user named jane on a server with IP address 192.168.1.100, you could use the following command:
```bash
$ vim ftp://jane@192.168.1.100/home/jane/test.txt
```
You will be prompted for a password if necessary. -->

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Vim is a powerful text editor with many features and capabilities. It can take some time to learn, but with practice, it can greatly improve your productivity and efficiency as a developer or writer. By familiarizing yourself with Vim's various modes, navigation and editing commands, search and replace functionality, undo/redo, saving files, syntax highlighting, and even remote file editing, you can make the most of this versatile tool.

Finally, if you want to manage [Vim plugins](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), you can use a plugin manager like Vundle. It simplifies the process of installing, updating, and removing plugins, and allows you to easily try out new plugins without cluttering up your Vim configuration.
